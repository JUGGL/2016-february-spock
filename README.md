# Demonstration Of Using Spock For Behaviour Driven Development

## Overview
Testing software is an important way to remove defects, ensure quality, and maintain working code over many
changes. By implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) we improve our ability to refactor code, but going further can
simplify testing AND improve our ability to find faults in our code. That's where Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) 
comes in.
